# Cyber Security Base Project

This is a project work for University of Helsinki course [Cyber Security Base](https://cybersecuritybase.mooc.fi/).

## Problem

Idea is to implement web application with some security vulnerabilities and provide steps to fix them. I decided to build simple blog service, in which registered users can post stories. 

**Notice: This applications purpose is to demonstrate security vulnerabilities. This app should not be used in production environment, unless vulnerabilities fixed**
